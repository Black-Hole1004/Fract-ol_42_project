# Fractol
Fractol is a small project that generates fractal images using the concept of complex numbers. It allows the user to zoom in and out of the fractals and switch between different types of fractals.

# Installation
- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Black-Hole1004/fract-ol_42_project.git```
- cd into the cloned directory
- Run ```make``` to compile the project
- Run the executable with ./fractol
# Usage
- Once the program is running, you can use the following commands:

- Use the arrow keys to move the fractal around
- Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out
- Use numbers to switch between different fractal types
- Press the escape key to quit the program
### Supported Fractals:  
The following fractals are currently supported:

- Mandelbrot Set
- Julia Set
- Burning Ship Fractal
- tricorn fractal
## Examples
Here are some example images generated using Fractol:
